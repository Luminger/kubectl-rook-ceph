# Health

Health command check health of the cluster and common configuration issues. Health command currently validates these things configurations (let us know if you would like to add other validation in health command):

1. at least three mon pods should running on different nodes
2. mon quorum and ceph health details
3. at least three osd pods should running on different nodes
4. all pods 'Running' status
5. placement group status
6. at least one mgr pod is running

Health commands logs have three ways of logging:

1. `Info`: This is just a logging information for the users.
2. `Warning`: which mean there is some improvement required in the cluster.
3. `Error`: This requires immediate user attention to get the cluster in healthy state.
